- **Groq API**: The API service providing access to open-source LLM models for all AI processing
- **Character Profile**: Rose's personality, background, and therapeutic approach configuration
- **Memory System**: The dual-layer memory architecture (short-term and long-term) for remembering user context
- **Healing Session**: A conversation interaction between the user and Rose
- **Railway Platform**: The cloud deployment platform for hosting the Rose System
- **React Frontend**: The web-based user interface built with React and animation libraries

2. THE Rose System SHALL use Groq API for speech-to-text transcription services
3. THE Rose System SHALL configure Groq API with appropriate open-source model selections for conversational AI
4. WHEN API calls fail, THE Rose System SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. THE Rose System SHALL validate that all required Groq API credentials are configured before starting

### Requirement 4: Memory and Context Management

**User Story:** As a user having multiple sessions with Rose, I want her to remember important details about my situation and emotional journey, so that conversations feel continuous and personalized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user shares personal information, THE Memory System SHALL extract and store relevant facts in long-term memory

3. WHEN the user interacts with the voice button, THE React Frontend SHALL provide clear visual states for listening, processing, and speaking
4. THE React Frontend SHALL implement smooth animations and transitions for state changes
5. THE React Frontend SHALL be responsive and functional across desktop and mobile browsers

### Requirement 6: Feature Prioritization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to disable image generation and WhatsApp features for the initial release, so that development focuses on core voice interaction while preserving code for future phases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Rose System SHALL disable image generation workflow paths in the router logic
2. THE Rose System SHALL disable WhatsApp interface endpoints and handlers
3. THE Rose System SHALL maintain image generation and WhatsApp code in the codebase for future activation
4. THE Rose System SHALL configure the workflow graph to only route to conversation and audio response nodes
5. THE Rose System SHALL mark image and WhatsApp related dependencies as optional in project configuration

### Requirement 7: Cloud Deployment

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy Rose to Railway or a similar platform, so that users can access the service online without complex infrastructure management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Rose System SHALL provide deployment configuration compatible with Railway platform
2. THE Rose System SHALL use environment variables for all configuration and secrets
3. WHEN deployed, THE Rose System SHALL serve the React Frontend and API endpoints from a single service
4. THE Rose System SHALL configure appropriate health check endpoints for platform monitoring
5. THE Rose System SHALL document the deployment process with step-by-step instructions

### Requirement 8: Text-to-Speech Voice Selection

**User Story:** As a user, I want Rose to speak with a natural, calming voice that matches her healer persona, so that the audio experience enhances the therapeutic interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Rose System SHALL configure text-to-speech with a female voice profile that sounds warm and grounding
