## Key Implementation Details

### Centralized TTS Function

```python
async def generate_voice_response(
    text_content: str, 
    thread_id: int
) -> tuple[str, cl.Audio | None]:
    """
    Generate voice response with TTS audio element.
    
    Features:
    - 10-second timeout
    - Circuit breaker integration
    - Comprehensive error handling
    - Detailed metrics logging
    - Graceful degradation
    - Auto-play enabled audio
    """
```

### Message Handler Integration

**Before (Inconsistent):**
```python
if workflow == "audio":
    # Generate audio
else:
    # Text only - NO VOICE!
```

**After (Consistent):**
```python
# Always generate voice for all message types
text, audio = await generate_voice_response(response_text, thread_id)
elements = [audio] if audio else []
```

### Error Handling Strategy

1. **Timeout (>10s):** Return text-only, log timeout
2. **API Failure:** Return text-only, log error details
3. **Circuit Breaker Open:** Return text-only, log circuit state
4. **Network Issues:** Return text-only, log network error

**Result:** User never sees error messages, always gets text response

## Performance Characteristics

### TTS Generation

**Target Performance:**
- Typical response (50-200 words): <3 seconds
- Maximum timeout: 10 seconds
- Success rate target: >95%

**Resource Usage:**
- Audio buffer: ~50-200KB per response
- Memory: Session-scoped TextToSpeech instances
- Network: ElevenLabs API calls (with circuit breaker)

**Optimization:**
- Using ElevenLabs turbo model (eleven_flash_v2_5)
- Session-scoped module instances (no per-message overhead)
- Circuit breaker prevents API overload

---

## Monitoring and Observability

### Log Patterns

**Success:**
```
TTS generation successful - thread_id=1, duration=2500ms, text_length=150, audio_size=75000 bytes
```

**Failure:**
```
TTS generation failed - thread_id=1, duration=500ms, text_length=150, circuit_state=CLOSED, error_type=Exception, error=API error
```

**Timeout:**
```
TTS generation timeout after 10s - thread_id=1, duration=10000ms, text_length=150
```

**Circuit Breaker:**
```
TTS circuit breaker open - thread_id=1, duration=100ms, text_length=150, circuit_state=OPEN, error=Circuit breaker open
```

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# View recent logs
docker logs rose-chainlit-1 --tail 100

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs rose-chainlit-1 --follow

# Search for TTS logs
docker logs rose-chainlit-1 | grep "TTS"

# Check for errors
docker logs rose-chainlit-1 | grep "ERROR"
```
