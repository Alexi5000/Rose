# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that Rose the Healer Shaman consistently responds with voice (TTS audio) for all user interactions, regardless of input modality (text or voice). Currently, the Chainlit interface only generates TTS for voice inputs and specific workflow types, causing inconsistent voice responses that break the voice-first healing experience.

## Glossary

- **Chainlit_Interface**: The web-based chat interface for Rose built using the Chainlit framework
- **TTS_Module**: The TextToSpeech module responsible for converting text responses to audio using ElevenLabs API
- **Response_Handler**: The message processing logic in the Chainlit interface that determines output format
- **Voice_First_Design**: The architectural principle that Rose should primarily communicate through voice to create a therapeutic, human-like healing experience
- **Audio_Element**: A Chainlit UI component that plays audio content with auto-play enabled

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user seeking healing support, I want Rose to always respond with her calming voice, so that I receive a consistent therapeutic audio experience regardless of how I communicate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a text message, THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL generate TTS audio for Rose's response
2. WHEN a user sends a voice message, THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL generate TTS audio for Rose's response
3. WHEN a user sends an image with text, THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL generate TTS audio for Rose's response
4. WHEN Rose generates a response, THE Response_Handler SHALL include an Audio_Element with auto-play enabled
5. WHEN the TTS_Module fails to generate audio, THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL log the error and send the text response as fallback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent TTS generation logic across all input handlers, so that the codebase is maintainable and voice behavior is predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL use a single shared function for TTS generation across all message handlers
2. WHEN processing any user input, THE Response_Handler SHALL invoke the shared TTS function
3. THE shared TTS function SHALL accept text content and return an Audio_Element
4. THE shared TTS function SHALL handle TTS_Module errors gracefully
5. THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL eliminate workflow-type conditional logic for TTS generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want Rose's voice responses to load quickly and reliably, so that my healing conversation flows naturally without interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating TTS audio, THE TTS_Module SHALL complete synthesis within 10 seconds
2. IF TTS synthesis exceeds 10 seconds, THEN THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL timeout and send text-only response
3. WHEN TTS synthesis fails, THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL log the error with full context
4. THE Response_Handler SHALL send the text response immediately while TTS generation occurs asynchronously
5. WHEN TTS audio is ready, THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL update the message with the Audio_Element

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want visibility into TTS generation success rates, so that I can monitor the voice-first experience quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TTS generation succeeds, THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL log success with response length
2. WHEN TTS generation fails, THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL log failure with error details
3. THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL log TTS generation duration for performance monitoring
4. WHEN circuit breaker opens for TTS_Module, THE Chainlit_Interface SHALL log the circuit state
5. THE logging output SHALL include thread_id for conversation tracking
