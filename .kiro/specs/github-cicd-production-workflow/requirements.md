# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for establishing a complete GitHub CI/CD pipeline with production and development branch workflows for the Rose AI Companion application. The system will ensure code quality, automated testing, deployment automation, and proper branch management strategies to support a professional development workflow.

## Glossary

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment automated workflow system
- **GitHub Actions**: GitHub's native CI/CD automation platform
- **Production Branch**: The `main` branch containing stable, production-ready code
- **Development Branch**: The `develop` branch for ongoing development and integration
- **Branch Protection Rules**: GitHub repository settings that enforce workflow requirements
- **Railway**: Cloud deployment platform for hosting the application
- **Codecov**: Code coverage reporting and tracking service
- **Conventional Commits**: Standardized commit message format (e.g., feat:, fix:, docs:)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a fully automated CI/CD pipeline so that code quality is enforced and deployments are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is opened, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL execute linting, formatting checks, unit tests, and coverage analysis
2. WHEN tests pass with coverage above 70%, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL allow the pull request to be merged
3. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL automatically deploy to production after all tests pass
4. WHEN code is pushed to the develop branch, THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL run all tests without deploying
5. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL upload coverage reports to Codecov and generate HTML coverage artifacts

### Requirement 2: Production and Development Branch Strategy

**User Story:** As a development team, I want separate production and development branches so that we can develop features safely without affecting production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Repository SHALL have a `main` branch designated as the production branch
2. THE Repository SHALL have a `develop` branch designated as the development integration branch
3. WHEN the current main branch state is finalized, THE Repository SHALL tag it as the initial production release
4. THE Repository SHALL configure branch protection rules requiring pull request reviews before merging to main
5. THE Repository SHALL configure branch protection rules requiring status checks to pass before merging

### Requirement 3: GitHub Branch Protection and Security

**User Story:** As a repository administrator, I want branch protection rules enforced so that code quality standards are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Repository SHALL require at least one approval for pull requests to the main branch
2. THE Repository SHALL require all status checks to pass before merging to main or develop
3. THE Repository SHALL prevent force pushes to the main branch
4. THE Repository SHALL prevent deletion of the main branch
5. THE Repository SHALL require linear history on the main branch to maintain clean git history

### Requirement 4: Automated Deployment Workflow

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployments to production so that releases are consistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is merged to the main branch, THE Deployment Workflow SHALL build a Docker image
2. WHEN the Docker image is built successfully, THE Deployment Workflow SHALL deploy to Railway production service
3. WHEN deployment completes, THE Deployment Workflow SHALL run post-deployment smoke tests
4. IF post-deployment tests fail, THEN THE Deployment Workflow SHALL notify the team and mark the deployment as failed
5. THE Deployment Workflow SHALL create a GitHub release with version tags for each production deployment

### Requirement 5: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear development workflow so that I know how to contribute features and fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Repository SHALL document the development workflow in a CONTRIBUTING.md file
2. WHEN a developer creates a feature, THE Workflow SHALL require creating a feature branch from develop
3. WHEN a feature is complete, THE Workflow SHALL require opening a pull request to develop
4. WHEN features are ready for release, THE Workflow SHALL require opening a pull request from develop to main
5. THE Workflow SHALL enforce conventional commit message format for all commits

### Requirement 6: Testing and Quality Gates

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing gates so that bugs are caught before production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CI Pipeline SHALL run unit tests with a minimum coverage threshold of 70%
2. THE CI Pipeline SHALL run integration tests on the develop branch
3. THE CI Pipeline SHALL run smoke tests before deployment to production
4. THE CI Pipeline SHALL run post-deployment verification tests after production deployment
5. IF any test suite fails, THEN THE CI Pipeline SHALL prevent merging or deployment

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Notifications

**User Story:** As a team member, I want notifications about CI/CD events so that I can respond to issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment to production completes, THE System SHALL create a GitHub release notification
2. WHEN CI/CD workflows fail, THE System SHALL provide detailed error logs in the GitHub Actions interface
3. WHEN coverage drops below threshold, THE System SHALL fail the build and report the coverage gap
4. THE System SHALL generate workflow summaries with test results and coverage metrics
5. THE System SHALL maintain workflow run history for at least 90 days

### Requirement 8: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configurations so that the application runs correctly in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Repository SHALL maintain separate environment configurations for development, staging, and production
2. THE CI/CD Pipeline SHALL use GitHub Secrets for sensitive configuration values
3. THE Repository SHALL document all required environment variables in .env.example
4. THE Deployment Workflow SHALL validate that all required environment variables are set before deployment
5. THE Repository SHALL never commit sensitive credentials or API keys to version control

### Requirement 9: Rollback and Recovery Procedures

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want rollback capabilities so that I can quickly recover from failed deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Deployment System SHALL maintain the previous production deployment for rollback purposes
2. THE Repository SHALL document rollback procedures in deployment documentation
3. WHEN a deployment fails post-deployment tests, THE System SHALL provide instructions for rollback
4. THE Repository SHALL tag each production deployment with semantic version numbers
5. THE Deployment System SHALL support deploying any previous tagged version

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Onboarding

**User Story:** As a new team member, I want comprehensive documentation so that I can understand and use the CI/CD system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Repository SHALL document the complete CI/CD pipeline in .github/README.md
2. THE Repository SHALL document the branch strategy and workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md
3. THE Repository SHALL provide troubleshooting guides for common CI/CD issues
4. THE Repository SHALL document how to set up GitHub Secrets and Railway configuration
5. THE Repository SHALL include examples of conventional commit messages and PR titles
