# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines requirements for identifying and addressing technical debt in the AI Companion application. Technical debt includes poorly written code, difficult-to-understand implementations, missing test coverage, code duplication, and architectural inconsistencies that hinder maintainability and future development.

## Glossary

- **Application**: The AI Companion application (Rose the Healer Shaman)
- **Test Coverage**: The percentage of code paths exercised by automated tests
- **Code Duplication**: Identical or similar code blocks repeated across multiple locations
- **Type Safety**: The degree to which type hints and validation prevent runtime type errors
- **Module**: A self-contained unit of functionality within the Application
- **Circuit Breaker**: A resilience pattern that prevents cascading failures by blocking calls to failing services
- **LangGraph**: The workflow orchestration framework used by the Application
- **Memory Manager**: The component responsible for long-term memory storage and retrieval using Qdrant

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Coverage Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for core modules, so that I can refactor code confidently without introducing regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Application's core modules are analyzed, THE Application SHALL identify modules with less than 50% test coverage
2. THE Application SHALL provide unit tests for the Memory Manager module that verify memory extraction, storage, and retrieval operations
3. THE Application SHALL provide unit tests for the Speech-to-Text module that verify audio transcription with various audio formats
4. THE Application SHALL provide unit tests for the Text-to-Speech module that verify audio synthesis and caching behavior
5. THE Application SHALL provide integration tests for the LangGraph workflow that verify end-to-end conversation flows

### Requirement 2: Code Duplication Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate code duplication, so that bug fixes and enhancements only need to be made in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error handling decorators are analyzed, THE Application SHALL identify duplicated sync and async wrapper implementations
2. THE Application SHALL consolidate duplicated error handling logic into reusable utility functions
3. WHEN circuit breaker implementations are analyzed, THE Application SHALL identify duplicated call and call_async methods
4. THE Application SHALL refactor circuit breaker logic to eliminate code duplication between sync and async paths
5. THE Application SHALL ensure all refactored code maintains backward compatibility with existing usage

### Requirement 3: Type Safety Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete type hints throughout the codebase, so that type checkers can catch errors before runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Application's Python files are analyzed, THE Application SHALL identify functions and methods missing return type hints
2. THE Application SHALL add type hints to all public functions in the graph nodes module
3. THE Application SHALL add type hints to all public functions in the memory modules
4. THE Application SHALL add type hints to all public functions in the speech modules
5. THE Application SHALL validate type hints using mypy or similar type checker without errors

### Requirement 4: Error Handling Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling patterns across all modules, so that errors are logged and handled uniformly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external API calls are made, THE Application SHALL use standardized error handling decorators
2. THE Application SHALL ensure all async functions use async-compatible error handling
3. WHEN circuit breakers are triggered, THE Application SHALL log circuit state changes with consistent formatting
4. THE Application SHALL provide user-friendly error messages that do not expose internal implementation details
5. THE Application SHALL record error metrics for all caught exceptions

### Requirement 5: Module Initialization Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate redundant module instantiation, so that the Application uses resources efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Chainlit interface creates module instances, THE Application SHALL use singleton pattern or dependency injection
2. THE Application SHALL eliminate global module instances in favor of factory functions or dependency injection
3. THE Application SHALL ensure module instances are reused across workflow executions within the same session
4. THE Application SHALL provide clear lifecycle management for stateful modules like Memory Manager
5. THE Application SHALL document module initialization patterns in code comments

### Requirement 6: Configuration Management Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized configuration validation, so that configuration errors are caught at startup rather than runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Application starts, THE Application SHALL validate all required environment variables before initializing services
2. THE Application SHALL provide clear error messages for missing or invalid configuration values
3. THE Application SHALL group related configuration settings into logical sections with documentation
4. THE Application SHALL validate configuration value ranges and formats using Pydantic validators
5. THE Application SHALL fail fast at startup if critical configuration is missing or invalid

### Requirement 7: Async/Await Pattern Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent async/await patterns throughout the codebase, so that asynchronous code is predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN async functions are defined, THE Application SHALL use async/await consistently without mixing sync and async patterns
2. THE Application SHALL eliminate blocking I/O operations in async functions
3. THE Application SHALL use asyncio-compatible libraries for all I/O operations in async contexts
4. THE Application SHALL document any necessary sync-to-async or async-to-sync bridges with clear rationale
5. THE Application SHALL validate async patterns using linting tools like ruff with async-specific rules

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Code Comments

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation for complex logic, so that I can understand and modify code without extensive investigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex algorithms are implemented, THE Application SHALL provide docstrings explaining the algorithm's purpose and behavior
2. THE Application SHALL document all public APIs with parameter descriptions, return types, and usage examples
3. THE Application SHALL add inline comments for non-obvious implementation decisions
4. THE Application SHALL document architectural patterns like circuit breakers and retry logic with references to design documents
5. THE Application SHALL maintain up-to-date module-level docstrings that describe module responsibilities

### Requirement 9: Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear dependency boundaries between modules, so that changes in one module don't unexpectedly affect others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules import dependencies, THE Application SHALL avoid circular dependencies
2. THE Application SHALL use dependency injection or factory patterns for cross-module dependencies
3. THE Application SHALL document module dependencies in module-level docstrings
4. THE Application SHALL ensure core modules do not depend on interface-specific implementations
5. THE Application SHALL validate dependency structure using import analysis tools

### Requirement 10: Performance Optimization Opportunities

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify performance bottlenecks, so that I can optimize critical paths in the Application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Application processes requests, THE Application SHALL identify synchronous operations that could be parallelized
2. THE Application SHALL document performance-critical code paths with timing expectations
3. THE Application SHALL use caching appropriately for expensive operations like TTS synthesis
4. THE Application SHALL avoid unnecessary object creation in hot paths
5. THE Application SHALL provide performance benchmarks for critical operations in test suite
