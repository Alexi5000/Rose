# Requirements Document: Deployment Readiness Review

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive deployment readiness review of the Rose the Healer Shaman application. After completing 10 implementation tasks, this review ensures the application is production-ready, identifies any gaps in functionality, security, performance, or operational concerns, and provides recommendations for improvements before deployment to Railway or other cloud platforms.
