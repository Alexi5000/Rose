## Notes

- Tasks 1-5 are **critical** and must be completed before production deployment
- Tasks 6-10 are **high priority** and should be completed soon after deployment
- Tasks 11-15 are **medium priority** and provide comprehensive production readiness
- All tasks are now required for a fully production-ready deployment
- Each task includes references to specific requirements from the requirements document
- Estimated total effort: 4-6 weeks for comprehensive implementation
