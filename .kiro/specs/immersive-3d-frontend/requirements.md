# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating an immersive, meditative 3D frontend experience for Rose the Healer Shaman. The interface will transport users into a peaceful, sacred space - evoking the tranquility of a shaman's lair on a cliff overlooking the ocean, a warm igloo in an Antarctic cave during a snowstorm, or a serene forest sanctuary beneath a waterfall. The experience prioritizes visual beauty, emotional calm, and seamless voice interaction without visible chat interfaces.

**Note:** The backend voice functionality is already implemented and working. This spec focuses exclusively on elevating the frontend visual and interaction design using modern web technologies including Lenis Scroll, GSAP, Framer Motion, React Three Fiber, Three.js, and ShadCN UI components.
