# The source code will be mounted via volume in docker-compose
# But we need to install the package in editable mode initially
# We'll assume the volume mount overlays this, but we need the egg-info/metadata
# So we might need to run the install command at runtime or ensure the volume mount works.
# Actually, `uv sync` installs the project if it's in the toml.
# Let's just set the python path or rely on uv run.
