An AI grief counselor and holistic healing companion powered by open-source LLMs through Groq. Rose provides empathetic support using ancient healing wisdom through a voice-first web interface.

## Overview

Rose is a voice-first AI companion designed to provide therapeutic support for grief counseling and emotional healing. Built on LangGraph workflow orchestration, Rose combines modern AI technology with ancient healing wisdom to create a warm, grounding presence for users seeking emotional support.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes automated testing and deployment via GitHub Actions:

- **Automated Testing**: Runs on every push and PR
- **Code Coverage**: Tracked via Codecov (70% minimum)
- **Smoke Tests**: Pre-deployment validation
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploys to Railway on main branch

See [CI_CD_SETUP.md](docs/CI_CD_SETUP.md) for setup instructions and configuration details.

## Configuration

### Model Selection

Configure models in `.env`:
```bash
TEXT_MODEL_NAME="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"      # Main conversation
SMALL_TEXT_MODEL_NAME="llama-3.1-8b-instant"   # Memory, routing
STT_MODEL_NAME="whisper-large-v3"              # Speech-to-text
```

### Voice Configuration
