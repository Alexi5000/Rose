# Branch Setup Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

### 1. Local Branch Structure
- ‚úÖ Created `develop` branch from `main`
- ‚úÖ Tagged current `main` as `v1.0.0` (production baseline)
- ‚úÖ All changes committed to `main` branch

### 2. Documentation Created
- ‚úÖ `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Code ownership definitions
- ‚úÖ `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md` - Detailed branch protection configuration guide
- ‚úÖ `.github/PUSH_PROTECTION_BYPASS.md` - Instructions for resolving push protection issue

### 3. Configuration Files
- ‚úÖ Updated `.env.example` with clearer placeholder formats
- ‚úÖ All files committed and ready to push

## ‚è≥ Pending Steps (Requires Manual Action)

### 1. Bypass GitHub Push Protection

GitHub's secret scanning has detected placeholder text in `.env.example` as a potential secret. This is a false positive.

**Action Required:**
1. Visit this URL to allow the secret:
   ```
   https://github.com/Alexi5000/Rose/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34UI1XAgpfFKTc3MEnxTTDexCO8
   ```

2. Click "Allow secret" or "It's used in tests"

3. Then run these commands to push:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   git push origin v1.0.0
   git push origin develop
   ```

### 2. Configure Branch Protection Rules

After successfully pushing the branches, configure branch protection rules via GitHub web interface:

1. Navigate to: `https://github.com/Alexi5000/Rose/settings/branches`

2. Follow the detailed instructions in `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md`

3. Configure protection for both `main` and `develop` branches

**Key Settings for `main` branch:**
- Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
- Require status checks: `code-quality`, `unit-tests`, `smoke-tests`
- Require branches to be up to date
- Require linear history
- Prevent force pushes
- Prevent deletions
- Enforce for administrators

**Key Settings for `develop` branch:**
- Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
- Require status checks: `code-quality`, `unit-tests`
- More flexible than main (allow merge commits, don't require up-to-date)

### 3. Update CODEOWNERS

Edit `.github/CODEOWNERS` and replace `@OWNER_USERNAME` with actual GitHub usernames or team names:

```bash
# Example:
* @yourusername

# Or for teams:
* @your-org/core-team
```

## üìã Verification Checklist

After completing the manual steps, verify:

- [ ] `main` branch exists on GitHub
- [ ] `develop` branch exists on GitHub
- [ ] Tag `v1.0.0` exists on GitHub
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured for `main`
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured for `develop`
- [ ] CODEOWNERS file updated with actual usernames
- [ ] Test creating a feature branch and opening a PR

## üîç Current Git Status

```bash
# Local branches
main (current)
develop

# Local tags
v1.0.0

# Commits ahead of origin
23 commits ahead of origin/main

# Files ready to push
- .github/CODEOWNERS
- .github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md
- .github/PUSH_PROTECTION_BYPASS.md
- .github/BRANCH_SETUP_STATUS.md
- .env.example (updated placeholders)
- .kiro/specs/github-cicd-production-workflow/ (spec files)
- .kiro/hooks/code-quality-analyzer.kiro.hook
```

## üìö Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Bypass push protection and push branches (see Pending Steps #1)
2. **Immediate:** Configure branch protection rules (see Pending Steps #2)
3. **Soon:** Update CODEOWNERS with actual usernames (see Pending Steps #3)
4. **Next Task:** Proceed to Task 2 - Configure GitHub Secrets and environment variables

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If push still fails after bypass
- Check if you have write access to the repository
- Verify you're authenticated with GitHub
- Try: `git push origin main --force-with-lease` (use with caution)

### If branch protection setup is unclear
- Refer to `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md` for detailed screenshots and steps
- GitHub docs: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches

### If CODEOWNERS isn't working
- Ensure file is in `.github/CODEOWNERS` (not `.github/` subdirectory)
- Verify usernames/team names are correct (case-sensitive)
- CODEOWNERS takes effect on next PR, not retroactively

## üìù Notes

- The secret scanning detection is actually a good security feature
- It prevents accidentally committing real secrets
- In this case, it's a false positive on placeholder text
- Future `.env.example` files should use clearly fake formats like `YOUR_KEY_HERE`
