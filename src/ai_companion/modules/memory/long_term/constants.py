"""Memory system constants and configuration values.

This module defines all magic numbers and configuration constants for the
long-term memory system. Following Uncle Bob's Clean Code principles, we
avoid magic numbers and make all values explicit with clear documentation.

Constants are organized by category:
- Collection Configuration: Database and collection settings
- Search Configuration: Similarity and retrieval parameters
- Model Configuration: Embedding model specifications
- Isolation Configuration: Multi-user data isolation settings

All constants include comments explaining their purpose and impact.

QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME = "long_term_memory"

This collection stores semantic embeddings of user memories for retrieval.

DUPLICATE_DETECTION_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.90
"""Cosine similarity threshold for detecting duplicate memories (0.0-1.0).

How this works:
- 1.0 = Identical embeddings (exact duplicates)
- 0.9 = Very similar (prevents near-duplicates)
- 0.8 = Similar but different enough to keep separate
- 0.7 = Related but distinct memories

Current value (0.90) means:
✅ "User loves coffee" and "User prefers coffee" → Duplicate (don't store)
❌ "User loves coffee" and "User drinks tea sometimes" → Different (store both)

Impact:
- Higher values → More duplicates stored (memory bloat)
- Lower values → Fewer memories stored (information loss)

Recommendation: 0.85-0.95 for most use cases

This is the max number of memories returned when no specific limit is requested.
Used internally by vector_store.search_memories() default behavior.

Why 5?
- Provides good context without overwhelming the prompt
- Balances relevance (top results) vs. diversity (more results)
- Fits within typical LLM context windows efficiently

Can be overridden per query. The MemoryManager uses MEMORY_TOP_K from settings
for actual retrieval (currently 3), which is the user-facing configuration.

This is the number shown to the LLM during conversation. Separate from
DEFAULT_MEMORY_SEARCH_LIMIT to allow different search vs. usage limits.

Why 3?
- Keeps context concise and focused
- Prevents context pollution with less-relevant memories
- Reduces token usage and improves response time
- Based on testing with 70B parameter LLMs

Impact of changing:
- Higher → More context, higher cost, potentially less focused responses
- Lower → Less context, may miss important information

Model specs:
- Dimensions: 384 (compact, efficient)
- Performance: ~14K tokens/sec on CPU
- Quality: Excellent for semantic similarity tasks
- Size: ~80MB (fast download and loading)

Why this model?
✅ Great balance of speed, size, and accuracy
✅ No GPU required (CPU-friendly for Docker deployments)
✅ Well-tested for semantic search applications
✅ Widely used and maintained by Hugging Face

Alternatives considered:
- all-mpnet-base-v2: Better accuracy, 768 dims, slower (overkill for this use case)
- all-MiniLM-L12-v2: Slightly better, but 2x slower (diminishing returns)
- text-embedding-ada-002: OpenAI, requires API calls, cost overhead (YAGNI)

⚠️ Changing this model INVALIDATES all existing embeddings
⚠️ Requires full re-indexing of memory collection
⚠️ Different dimension size requires collection recreation
