"""Long-term memory management for the AI companion.

This module provides the MemoryManager class which handles extraction, storage,
and retrieval of important information from conversations. It uses an LLM to
analyze messages for importance and formats them for storage in a vector database.

The memory system enables the AI companion to remember user preferences, past
conversations, and important context across sessions, creating a more personalized
and therapeutic experience.

Module Dependencies:
- ai_companion.core.prompts: MEMORY_ANALYSIS_PROMPT for LLM-based memory extraction
- ai_companion.modules.memory.long_term.vector_store: VectorStore for memory persistence
- ai_companion.settings: Configuration for LLM model, temperature, timeouts
- langchain_core.messages: BaseMessage types for message handling
- langchain_groq: ChatGroq for LLM inference
- pydantic: BaseModel for structured output (MemoryAnalysis)
- Standard library: logging, uuid, datetime, typing

Dependents (modules that import this):
- ai_companion.graph.nodes: memory_extraction_node, memory_injection_node
- Test modules: tests/unit/test_memory_manager.py

Architecture:
This module is part of the modules layer and orchestrates memory operations by
combining LLM analysis (via Groq) with vector storage (via Qdrant). It follows
the factory pattern for instantiation (get_memory_manager) to support dependency
injection and testing.

For detailed architecture documentation, see:
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: Memory System Architecture section
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: Module Initialization Patterns section (Factory Functions)

Design Reference:
- .kiro/specs/technical-debt-management/design.md: Type Safety Enhancement section

Example:
    Basic usage of the memory manager:

    >>> manager = get_memory_manager()
    >>> message = HumanMessage(content="I love hiking in the mountains")
    >>> await manager.extract_and_store_memories(message)
    >>> memories = manager.get_relevant_memories("outdoor activities")
    >>> print(memories)
    ['User enjoys hiking in mountainous terrain']
