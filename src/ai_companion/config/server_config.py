"""Server configuration constants for Rose the Healer Shaman.

This module centralizes all magic numbers and configuration values used by the
web interface, eliminating hardcoded values and improving maintainability.

All constants use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE naming convention and are organized by
concern with emoji indicators for easy visual scanning.
