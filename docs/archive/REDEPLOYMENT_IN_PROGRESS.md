```

### 3. Rebuilt Frontend (7 seconds)
```bash
✅ Frontend built successfully in 6.86s
✅ Output: 1.35 MB total (377 kB gzipped)
✅ Assets generated:
   - index.html (0.88 kB)
   - CSS (21.84 kB → 5.01 kB gzipped)
   - JavaScript bundles (1.3 MB → 372 kB gzipped)
   - Three.js engine (655 kB → 164 kB gzipped)
```

## 🔄 Currently Building

### 4. Docker Multi-Stage Build (~8 minutes)

**Stage Progress:**
- ✅ Metadata and context loaded
- ✅ Python builder base image pulled
- 🔄 **Installing build dependencies** (gcc, g++, build-essential)
- ⏳ Installing Python packages (~3 min remaining)
  - FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph
  - Groq SDK, ElevenLabs SDK
  - Qdrant client
  - ⚠️ Sentence-transformers (2.5GB CUDA libraries)
- ⏳ Copying frontend build
- ⏳ Creating runtime image
- ⏳ Exporting final image (~2 min)

**Expected Final Image Size**: ~3GB
*(Note: Can be optimized to 300MB by removing CUDA - see `/optimize-image`)*

---

## ⏳ Pending Steps

### 5. Start Fresh Containers (30 seconds)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Will start:
- Qdrant vector database (port 6333)
- Rose backend + frontend (port 8000)

### 6. Health Verification (10 seconds)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```
Expected result: All services connected (Groq, ElevenLabs, Qdrant, SQLite)

### 7. Voice Interaction Test (30 seconds)
1. Open http://localhost:8000
2. Allow microphone permission
3. Press and HOLD Space bar
4. Say: "Hello Rose, how are you?"
5. Release Space bar
6. Wait for Rose's voice response

   - No errors in recent logs

3. ✅ **Frontend Loading**
   - `http://localhost:8000/` loads HTML
   - All assets (CSS, JS) accessible
   - No CORS errors in browser console

4. ✅ **Voice Interaction**
   - Microphone permission granted
   - Press-and-hold pattern works
   - Voice processing completes successfully
   - Audio response plays back
   - No errors in console or logs
