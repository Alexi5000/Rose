# Test backend API
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "services": {
    "groq": "connected",

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Docker Desktop Won't Start

**Error**: "Docker Desktop is starting..."
- **Wait**: Can take 1-2 minutes on first start
- **Check**: System resources (needs 2GB RAM, 2GB disk)
- **Restart**: Close and reopen Docker Desktop

**Error**: "WSL 2 installation is incomplete"
```powershell
# Install WSL 2
wsl --install
# Restart computer
```

### Containers Won't Start

**Error**: "port 8000 is already allocated"
```bash
# Find what's using port 8000
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Kill the process (replace PID)
taskkill //PID <PID> //F

# Retry
docker-compose up -d
```

**Error**: "port 6333 is already allocated"
```bash
# Stop old Qdrant container
docker stop rose-qdrant
docker rm rose-qdrant

# Retry
docker-compose up -d
```

### Health Check Fails

**Error**: API returns 503 or connection refused
```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs rose --tail 50

# Common issues:
# - Missing .env file
# - Invalid API keys
# - Services still starting (wait 30s)
```

### Voice Still Doesn't Work

**After containers are running:**

1. **Check browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console):
   - Should see: "üîå Initializing API client"
   - Should NOT see: "‚ùå Backend unreachable"

2. **Verify microphone permission**:
   - Click padlock in address bar
   - Ensure "Microphone" is "Allow"
   - Refresh page

3. **Test press-and-hold pattern**:
   - HOLD Space (don't click once)
   - Speak while holding
   - RELEASE Space (this sends the request)

## üìä Quick Diagnostic Commands

**Is Docker Running?**
```bash
docker ps
# Should list containers, not error
```

**Are Containers Running?**
```bash
docker-compose ps
# Should show "Up" status
```

**Is Backend Accessible?**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
# Should return JSON with "healthy"
```

**Are There Recent Errors?**
```bash
docker-compose logs rose --tail 50 | grep -E "ERROR|‚ùå"
# Should be empty or minimal
```
