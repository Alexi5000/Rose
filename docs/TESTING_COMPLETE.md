## Running the Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install test dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[test]"

# Run unit tests only (no API keys needed)
pytest tests/ -v -m "not integration and not e2e"

# Run integration tests (requires API keys)
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_key
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key
export QDRANT_URL=your_url
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v -m integration

# Run E2E tests (requires server running)
uvicorn ai_companion.interfaces.web.app:app --port 8080 &
uv pip install -e ".[playwright]"
playwright install
pytest tests/test_e2e_playwright.py -v -m e2e --headed

# Run smoke tests
pytest tests/test_post_deployment_smoke.py -v -m smoke

# Run all tests with coverage
pytest tests/ -v --cov=ai_companion --cov-report=html
```

### Using Helper Scripts

```bash
# Unix/Mac
./tests/run_integration_tests.sh all

# Windows
tests\run_integration_tests.bat all
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

The documentation includes a complete GitHub Actions workflow with:
- Unit tests job
- Integration tests job (with API keys from secrets)
- E2E tests job (with Playwright)
- Smoke tests job (after deployment)
- Coverage reporting to Codecov
- Screenshot upload on E2E test failures

### Railway Deployment

Smoke tests can be run automatically after Railway deployment:

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Railway
  id: deploy
  run: railway up

- name: Run smoke tests
  env:
    DEPLOYED_URL: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.url }}
  run: pytest tests/test_post_deployment_smoke.py -v -m smoke
```
