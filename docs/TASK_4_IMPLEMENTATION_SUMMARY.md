# Task 4 Implementation Summary: Resource Limits and Monitoring

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 4 from the deployment readiness review: "Configure resource limits and monitoring". All sub-tasks have been completed successfully.

## Completed Sub-Tasks

### 1. ✅ Add Memory Limits to Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml

**Dockerfile Changes:**
- Added `MEMORY_LIMIT` environment variable (default: 512m)
- Documented memory limit configuration in comments
- Location: `Dockerfile` line 45

**docker-compose.yml Changes:**
- Added resource limits for both `chainlit` and `whatsapp` services
- Memory limit: 512M
- Memory reservation: 256M
- Location: `docker-compose.yml` lines 23-27, 42-46

**Configuration:**
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 512M
    reservations:
      memory: 256M
```

### 2. ✅ Implement Structured Logging with JSON Output

**New Files Created:**
- `src/ai_companion/core/logging_config.py` - Structured logging configuration

**Features Implemented:**
- JSON output for production (parseable logs)
- Console output for development (human-readable)
- Configurable log level via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
- Configurable format via `LOG_FORMAT` environment variable
- ISO timestamp format
- Exception info rendering
- Automatic context binding

**Dependencies Added:**
- `structlog>=24.1.0` in `pyproject.toml`

**Settings Added:**
- `LOG_LEVEL` (default: INFO)
- `LOG_FORMAT` (default: json)

**Usage Example:**
```python
from ai_companion.core.logging_config import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("user_action", user_id="123", action="voice_input")
```

**Log Output (JSON):**
```json
{
  "event": "user_action",
  "user_id": "123",
  "action": "voice_input",
  "request_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "logger": "ai_companion.interfaces.web.routes.voice",
  "level": "info",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T00:46:31.040719Z"
}
```

### 3. ✅ Add Request ID Middleware for Request Tracing

**New Middleware Created:**
- `RequestIDMiddleware` in `src/ai_companion/interfaces/web/middleware.py`

**Features Implemented:**
- Generates unique UUID for each request
- Stores request ID in `request.state.request_id`
- Adds `X-Request-ID` header to all responses
- Binds request ID to structlog context (automatic inclusion in all logs)
- Enables distributed tracing across service calls

**Integration:**
- Added to FastAPI app in `src/ai_companion/interfaces/web/app.py`
- Positioned as first middleware for complete request tracking

**Usage:**
```python
# In route handlers
request_id = request.state.request_id

# In responses
# X-Request-ID: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890

# In logs (automatic)
# All logs for a request include the same request_id
```

### 4. ✅ Enhance Health Check Endpoint with Database Verification

**Enhanced Health Check:**
- Added SQLite database connectivity check
- Verifies database file exists or can be created
- Tests database with simple query (`SELECT 1`)
- Ensures data directory is writable

**Updated File:**
- `src/ai_companion/interfaces/web/routes/health.py`

**New Checks:**
1. Groq API connectivity (existing)
2. ElevenLabs connectivity (existing)
3. Qdrant connectivity (existing)
4. **SQLite database verification (NEW)**

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "services": {
    "groq": "connected",
    "elevenlabs": "connected",
    "qdrant": "connected",
    "sqlite": "connected"
  }
}
```

## Additional Improvements

### Updated Configuration Files

**`.env.example`:**
- Added `LOG_LEVEL` documentation
- Added `LOG_FORMAT` documentation
- Documented production vs development settings

**`railway.json`:**
- Already had health check configuration (no changes needed)
- Health check path: `/api/health`
- Health check timeout: 30 seconds
- Restart policy: ON_FAILURE with 3 max retries

### Documentation Created

**`docs/MONITORING_AND_OBSERVABILITY.md`:**
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Structured logging configuration and usage
- Request ID tracking implementation
- Enhanced health checks
- Resource limits configuration
- Monitoring best practices
- Log aggregation strategies
- Alerting recommendations
- Troubleshooting guide

## Files Modified

1. `pyproject.toml` - Added structlog dependency
2. `Dockerfile` - Added memory limit environment variable
3. `docker-compose.yml` - Added resource limits
4. `src/ai_companion/settings.py` - Added LOG_LEVEL and LOG_FORMAT settings
5. `src/ai_companion/interfaces/web/app.py` - Integrated structured logging and request ID middleware
6. `src/ai_companion/interfaces/web/middleware.py` - Added RequestIDMiddleware
7. `src/ai_companion/interfaces/web/routes/health.py` - Enhanced with SQLite check
8. `.env.example` - Documented new logging settings

## Files Created

1. `src/ai_companion/core/logging_config.py` - Structured logging configuration
2. `docs/MONITORING_AND_OBSERVABILITY.md` - Comprehensive documentation
3. `docs/TASK_4_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Verified structlog import and configuration
2. ✅ Tested structured logging with JSON output
3. ✅ Verified middleware imports successfully
4. ✅ Confirmed no diagnostic errors in modified files
5. ✅ Validated dependency installation with `uv sync`

## Requirements Addressed

This implementation addresses the following requirements from the design document:

- **Requirement 3.2**: Memory limits configured in Docker
- **Requirement 4.1**: Structured logging with sufficient context
- **Requirement 4.2**: Performance metrics capability (via structured logs)
- **Requirement 4.4**: Structured logging with appropriate log levels

## Next Steps

To use these features in production:

1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   LOG_FORMAT=json
   ```

2. **Deploy with Resource Limits:**
   - Docker Compose: Already configured
   - Railway: Configure memory limits in dashboard

3. **Monitor Logs:**
   - Use Railway log viewer
   - Or aggregate to external service (Datadog, New Relic, etc.)

4. **Set Up Alerts:**
   - Error rate > 5%
   - Health check status = "degraded"
   - Memory usage > 80%

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Test structured logging
uv run python -c "from ai_companion.core.logging_config import configure_logging, get_logger; configure_logging(); logger = get_logger('test'); logger.info('test', status='ok')"

# Verify middleware import
uv run python -c "from ai_companion.interfaces.web.middleware import RequestIDMiddleware; print('OK')"

# Check diagnostics
# (No errors found in any modified files)
```

## Conclusion

All sub-tasks for Task 4 have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ Memory limits configured in Docker
- ✅ Structured logging with JSON output
- ✅ Request ID middleware for tracing
- ✅ Enhanced health checks with database verification

The application now has comprehensive monitoring and observability features ready for production deployment.
