## Railway Deployment (Recommended)

Railway provides the simplest deployment experience with automatic builds and zero-config deployments.

> **ðŸ“– Comprehensive Guide**: For detailed Railway setup instructions including volume configuration, environment-specific deployments, and troubleshooting, see **[Railway Setup Guide](RAILWAY_SETUP.md)**.

### Prerequisites

1. A [Railway account](https://railway.app/)
2. Railway CLI installed (optional): `npm i -g @railway/cli`
3. All required API keys (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables))

### Deployment Steps

#### Option 1: Deploy via Railway Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Create a New Project**
   - Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Connect your GitHub account and select your repository

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In your Railway project, go to the "Variables" tab
   - Add all required environment variables (see list below)
   - Railway automatically sets `PORT` - no need to configure it

3. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically detect the `railway.json` configuration
   - The build process will:
     - Install Python dependencies with `uv`
     - Build the React frontend
     - Start the FastAPI server
   - Wait for the deployment to complete (usually 3-5 minutes)

4. **Configure Persistent Volume** (Critical!)
   - In the Railway dashboard, go to your service
   - Navigate to the "Variables" tab
   - Scroll to "Volumes" section and click "+ New Volume"
   - Set mount path to `/app/data` and size to 1GB minimum
   - Redeploy the service to apply the volume
   - **Important**: Without this step, all conversation data will be lost on restart!
   - See [Data Persistence Guide](DATA_PERSISTENCE.md) for detailed instructions

5. **Access Your Application**
   - Railway will provide a public URL (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app`)
   - Visit the URL to interact with Rose

#### Option 2: Deploy via Railway CLI

```bash
# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project (or create new)
railway link

# Set environment variables
railway variables set GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
railway variables set ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here
# ... (set all required variables)

# Deploy
railway up
```

### Railway Configuration

The `railway.json` file in the project root configures:

- **Build Command**: Installs Python deps and builds React frontend
- **Start Command**: Runs uvicorn server on Railway's assigned port
- **Health Check**: `/api/health` endpoint for monitoring
- **Restart Policy**: Automatic restart on failure (max 3 retries)

#### Environment-Specific Configurations

The project includes optimized configurations for different environments:

- **Development**: `config/dev.env` - Local development with verbose logging
- **Staging**: `config/railway-staging.json` - Testing environment with moderate resources
- **Production**: `config/railway-prod.json` - Production-ready with strict security

To deploy to a specific environment:
```bash
# For staging
cp config/railway-staging.json railway.json

# For production
cp config/railway-prod.json railway.json

# Commit and push
git add railway.json
git commit -m "Configure for [environment]"
git push
```

See `config/README.md` for detailed configuration differences.

## Production Build Process

### Understanding the Build

The application uses a multi-stage build process:

1. **Frontend Build** (Vite)
   - Compiles React/TypeScript to optimized JavaScript
   - Outputs to `src/ai_companion/interfaces/web/static/`
   - Includes all CSS, 3D assets, and audio files
   - Build command: `npm run build` (in frontend directory)

2. **Backend Setup** (FastAPI)
   - Serves the compiled frontend as static files
   - Provides REST API endpoints at `/api/v1/`
   - Handles voice processing and session management

### Build Configuration

The frontend build path is configured in `frontend/vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
build: {
  outDir: '../src/ai_companion/interfaces/web/static',
  emptyOutDir: true,
}
```

This ensures the frontend builds directly into the location where FastAPI expects to find it.

### Local Production Testing

Before deploying, test the production build locally:

```bash
# Build and serve production version
python scripts/build_and_serve.py
```

This will:
1. ðŸŽ¨ Build the frontend with production optimizations
2. ðŸš€ Start FastAPI server serving both static files and API
3. Serve the application at http://localhost:8000

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

**Frontend Build Fails**:
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- Run `npm install` in frontend directory
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run type-check`
- Verify all environment variables are set in `frontend/.env`

**Static Files Not Loading**:
- Verify build output exists at `src/ai_companion/interfaces/web/static/`
- Check that `index.html` and `assets/` directory are present
- Ensure FastAPI is configured to serve from correct path
- Check browser console for 404 errors

**API Connection Issues**:
- Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set correctly in frontend `.env`
- For production, this should be `/api/v1` (relative path)
- For development, this should be `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

These variables **must** be set for the application to function:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | API key for Groq (LLM and STT) | `gsk_...` |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | API key for ElevenLabs (TTS) | `sk_...` |
| `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` | Voice ID for Rose's voice | `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM` |
| `TOGETHER_API_KEY` | API key for Together AI (image gen) | `...` |
| `QDRANT_URL` | Qdrant vector database URL | `https://xyz.qdrant.io` |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | Qdrant API key (if using cloud) | `...` |

### Optional Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ROSE_VOICE_ID` | Override voice ID specifically for Rose | Uses `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` |
| `PORT` | Server port (auto-set by platforms) | `8000` |
| `HOST` | Server host | `0.0.0.0` |
| `SHORT_TERM_MEMORY_DB_PATH` | Path to SQLite memory database | `/app/data/memory.db` |

### Frontend Environment Variables

The frontend requires configuration during the build process. These are set in `frontend/.env`:

| Variable | Description | Development | Production |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | API endpoint base URL | `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` | `/api/v1` |

**Important Notes**:
- Frontend environment variables are **baked into the build** at compile time
- For production deployments, use relative paths (e.g., `/api/v1`) to avoid CORS issues
- Changes to frontend `.env` require rebuilding the frontend
- Most deployment platforms handle this automatically during the build process

### Frozen Features (Not Required)

These variables are for features currently disabled:

- `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`
- `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`
- `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`

---

## Data Persistence

**Critical**: The application requires persistent storage to retain conversation data and memories across deployments.

### Railway Volume Setup

Railway uses ephemeral storage by default. You **must** configure a persistent volume:

1. In Railway dashboard, navigate to your service
2. Go to "Variables" tab â†’ "Volumes" section
3. Click "+ New Volume"
4. Configure:
   - **Mount Path**: `/app/data`
   - **Size**: 1GB minimum (recommended)
5. Redeploy service to apply changes

### Automatic Backups

The application includes automatic backup features:

- **Database Backups**: Daily at 2:00 AM (keeps 7 days)
- **Audio Cleanup**: Hourly cleanup of temporary files older than 24 hours
- **Backup Location**: `/app/data/backups/`
