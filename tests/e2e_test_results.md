## Manual Testing Instructions

### How to Perform Manual Tests

Since this is an automated testing agent, manual testing requires human interaction. The following tests should be performed by a human tester:

1. **Open Browser:** Navigate to http://localhost:8000
2. **Open Developer Console:** Press F12 to monitor for errors
3. **Follow Test Cases:** Use the guide in `tests/manual_e2e_voice_first_testing.md`

### Test Cases to Perform

#### Test 1: 10 Consecutive Text Messages
- Send 10 text messages
- Verify each response has audio
- Verify audio auto-plays
- Check for console errors

#### Test 2: 10 Consecutive Voice Messages
- Send 10 voice messages
- Verify each response has audio
- Verify audio auto-plays
- Check transcription accuracy

#### Test 3: Mixed Text and Voice
- Alternate between text and voice inputs
- Verify consistent audio responses
- Check for any behavioral differences

#### Test 4: Image with Text
- Upload an image with text
- Verify response has both image and audio
- Verify audio auto-plays

#### Test 5: TTS Failure Handling
- Simulate failure (disconnect network temporarily)
- Verify graceful degradation to text-only
- Verify no user-facing errors

#### Test 6: Browser Console Check
- Monitor console throughout all tests
- Document any errors or warnings

#### Test 7: Server Log Review
- Check Docker logs: `docker logs rose-chainlit-1`
- Verify TTS success/failure logging
- Verify metrics logging (duration, text_length, audio_size)

## Implementation Verification

### Code Review Checklist
- ✅ Centralized `generate_voice_response()` function implemented
- ✅ All message handlers use centralized TTS function
- ✅ Workflow-type conditional logic removed for TTS
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with logging
- ✅ Circuit breaker integration
- ✅ Timeout handling (10s)
- ✅ Graceful degradation on failure
- ✅ Audio element with auto-play enabled
- ✅ Thread ID included in all logs

### Requirements Coverage
- ✅ Requirement 1.1: Text messages generate voice responses
- ✅ Requirement 1.2: Voice messages generate voice responses
- ✅ Requirement 1.3: Image messages generate voice responses
- ✅ Requirement 1.4: Audio elements with auto-play
- ✅ Requirement 1.5: TTS failure graceful degradation
- ✅ Requirement 2.1: Single shared TTS function
- ✅ Requirement 2.2: All handlers invoke shared function
- ✅ Requirement 2.3: Function accepts text and returns audio
- ✅ Requirement 2.4: Graceful error handling
- ✅ Requirement 2.5: No workflow-type conditionals
- ✅ Requirement 3.1: TTS completes within 10s
- ✅ Requirement 3.2: Timeout handling
- ✅ Requirement 3.3: Error logging with context
- ✅ Requirement 3.4: Text response sent immediately
- ✅ Requirement 3.5: Audio element added when ready
- ✅ Requirement 4.1: Success logging with metrics
- ✅ Requirement 4.2: Failure logging with details
- ✅ Requirement 4.3: Duration logging
- ✅ Requirement 4.4: Circuit breaker state logging
- ✅ Requirement 4.5: Thread ID in all logs

## Docker Log Analysis

### How to Check Logs

```bash
# View recent logs
docker logs rose-chainlit-1 --tail 100

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs rose-chainlit-1 --follow

# Search for TTS-related logs
docker logs rose-chainlit-1 | grep "TTS"
```

### Expected Log Patterns

**Success Logs:**
```
TTS generation successful - thread_id=1, duration=XXXms, text_length=XX, audio_size=XXXX bytes
```

**Failure Logs:**
```
TTS generation failed - thread_id=1, duration=XXXms, text_length=XX, circuit_state=CLOSED, error_type=Exception, error=...
```

**Timeout Logs:**
```
TTS generation timeout after 10s - thread_id=1, duration=10000ms, text_length=XX
```

**Circuit Breaker Logs:**
```
TTS circuit breaker open - thread_id=1, duration=XXms, text_length=XX, circuit_state=OPEN, error=...
```

## Test Execution Status

### Automated Tests
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - All 10 unit tests passed

### Manual Tests
- ⏸️ **PENDING** - Requires human tester to perform browser-based testing

### Next Steps for Human Tester

1. **Access Application:**
   - Open browser to http://localhost:8000
   - Ensure audio is enabled

2. **Follow Test Guide:**
   - Use `tests/manual_e2e_voice_first_testing.md`
   - Complete all 8 test cases
   - Document results

3. **Review Logs:**
   - Check Docker logs for TTS operations
   - Verify logging patterns match expected format
   - Document any anomalies

4. **Update Task Status:**
   - Mark task 7 as complete in `.kiro/specs/voice-first-consistency/tasks.md`
   - Document any issues found

## Summary

### What Was Completed
1. ✅ All automated unit tests passing (10/10)
2. ✅ Implementation verified against requirements
3. ✅ Docker environment confirmed running
4. ✅ Manual testing guide created
5. ✅ Test results documentation created

### What Requires Human Interaction
