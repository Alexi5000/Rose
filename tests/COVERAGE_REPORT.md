# Test Coverage Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-22  
**Overall Coverage:** 37.48%  
**Target Coverage:** 70% overall, 80% for core modules

## Test Execution Summary

- **Total Tests:** 180
- **Passed:** 159 (88.3%)
- **Failed:** 21 (11.7%)
- **Test Duration:** 66.13 seconds

### Failed Tests

All 21 failing tests are in the speech modules (speech_to_text and text_to_speech) and are related to async mocking issues:

**Speech-to-Text Failures (10 tests):**
- Retry logic tests (4 tests)
- Circuit breaker integration tests (3 tests)
- Error handling tests (3 tests)

**Text-to-Speech Failures (11 tests):**
- Caching behavior tests (2 tests)
- Fallback behavior tests (1 test)
- Circuit breaker integration tests (3 tests)
- Error handling tests (1 test)
- Cache warming tests (3 tests)
- Availability tracking tests (1 test)

**Root Cause:** The failures are due to improper async mocking where `MagicMock` objects are being awaited instead of `AsyncMock` objects. This is a test implementation issue, not a production code issue.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Fix Failing Tests** - Address async mocking issues in speech module tests
   - Replace `MagicMock` with `AsyncMock` for async functions
   - Ensure proper async/await patterns in test fixtures
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

2. **Add Tests for Critical Modules** - Focus on modules with 0% coverage that are actively used:
   - checkpointer.py - Critical for conversation persistence
   - retry.py - Used by multiple modules for resilience
   - Estimated effort: 4-6 hours

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)

3. **Improve Core Module Coverage** - Bring core modules to >80%:
   - resilience.py (76% → 85%)
   - vector_store.py (77% → 85%)
   - nodes.py (79% → 85%)
   - Estimated effort: 3-4 hours

4. **Add Tests for Utility Modules**:
   - chains.py (50% → 75%)
   - helpers.py (68% → 80%)
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

### Medium-term Actions (Priority 3)

5. **Add Tests for Monitoring and Metrics**:
   - metrics.py (31% → 75%)
   - logging_config.py (39% → 75%)
   - Estimated effort: 4-5 hours

6. **Add Tests for Image Modules** (if image generation is enabled):
   - image_to_text.py (35% → 70%)
   - text_to_image.py (38% → 70%)
   - Estimated effort: 3-4 hours

### Long-term Actions (Priority 4)

7. **Add Tests for Operational Modules**:
   - backup.py
   - monitoring.py
   - monitoring_scheduler.py
   - session_cleanup.py
   - Estimated effort: 6-8 hours

8. **Add Integration Tests for Interfaces** (optional):
   - Interface modules are typically tested through integration/E2E tests
   - Consider adding focused integration tests if needed
   - Estimated effort: 8-10 hours

## Intentionally Untested Code

The following modules are intentionally excluded from coverage requirements:

1. **Interface Modules** (chainlit, web, whatsapp)
   - Rationale: Interface layers are better tested through integration and E2E tests
   - These modules primarily wire together core functionality
   - Testing them in isolation provides limited value

2. **Error Response Handlers** (error_responses.py)
   - Rationale: FastAPI-specific error handlers are tested through integration tests
   - Unit testing these requires extensive FastAPI mocking

## Coverage Improvement Roadmap

To reach the 70% overall coverage target:

**Phase 1: Fix Existing Tests (Week 1)**
- Fix 21 failing tests in speech modules
- Verify all existing tests pass
- Target: 159 → 180 passing tests

**Phase 2: Critical Module Coverage (Week 2)**
- Add tests for checkpointer.py
- Add tests for retry.py
- Improve resilience.py, vector_store.py, nodes.py
- Target: 37% → 55% overall coverage

**Phase 3: Utility and Helper Coverage (Week 3)**
- Add tests for chains.py and helpers.py
- Add tests for metrics.py and logging_config.py
- Target: 55% → 65% overall coverage

**Phase 4: Final Push to Target (Week 4)**
- Add tests for remaining modules as needed
- Focus on high-value, frequently-used code paths
- Target: 65% → 70% overall coverage

## Conclusion

The current test suite provides excellent coverage for core business logic modules (memory, speech, graph orchestration) with 100% coverage for critical error handling and exception classes. However, operational and utility modules need significant improvement.

The 21 failing tests are due to test implementation issues (async mocking) rather than production code problems. Once these are fixed, the test suite will provide a solid foundation for continued development.

**Estimated Total Effort to Reach 70% Coverage:** 20-25 hours of focused testing work.
