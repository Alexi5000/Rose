### 3. Dependencies Added

Updated `pyproject.toml` with test dependencies:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
test = [
    "pytest>=8.0.0",
    "pytest-asyncio>=0.23.0",
    "pytest-mock>=3.12.0",
    "pytest-cov>=4.1.0",
    "locust>=2.20.0",
]
playwright = [
    "playwright>=1.40.0",
    "pytest-playwright>=0.4.0",
]
```

## How to Use

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install test dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[test]"

# Run all tests
./run_tests.sh all          # Unix/Linux/Mac
run_tests.bat all           # Windows

# Or use pytest directly
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

### Run Specific Test Categories

```bash
# Voice interaction tests
./run_tests.sh voice

# Character tests
./run_tests.sh character

# Memory tests
./run_tests.sh memory

# Performance tests
./run_tests.sh performance

# Deployment tests
./run_tests.sh deployment

### Load Testing

```bash
# Install locust
uv pip install -e ".[test]"

# Start server
uvicorn ai_companion.interfaces.web.app:app

2. Run core tests to verify setup: `./run_tests.sh core`
3. Run all tests: `./run_tests.sh all`
4. Review any failures and fix issues

### Before Deployment
1. Run full test suite locally
2. Complete manual frontend testing checklist
3. Run load tests to establish baselines
4. Validate deployment configuration
5. Test against staging environment

### After Deployment
1. Run deployed instance tests
2. Monitor performance metrics
3. Set up continuous monitoring
4. Schedule regular load tests

### Optional Enhancements
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated tests
2. Install Playwright for automated frontend tests
3. Configure code coverage reporting
4. Set up performance monitoring dashboards

## Testing Philosophy

The testing suite follows these principles:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All critical paths tested
2. **Fast Feedback**: Unit tests run quickly with mocks
3. **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests use realistic therapeutic conversations
4. **Production Validation**: Deployment tests verify production readiness
5. **Documentation**: Every test is documented and explained

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing test structure and naming
2. Use appropriate mocking for external services
3. Add documentation to test methods
4. Update README.md with new test information

### Updating Tests
1. Keep tests in sync with code changes
2. Update mocks when API contracts change
3. Maintain test documentation
4. Run full suite after changes

## Success Criteria

All tasks from section 10 (Testing and validation) have been completed:

- ✅ 10.1: Voice interaction flow tests
- ✅ 10.2: Rose character and therapeutic response tests
- ✅ 10.3: Memory system with therapeutic context tests
- ✅ 10.4: Frontend testing (automated + manual)
