### Useful Log Patterns

**Success:**
```
TTS generation successful - thread_id=X, duration=XXXms, text_length=XX, audio_size=XXXX bytes
```

**Failure:**
```
TTS generation failed - thread_id=X, duration=XXXms, text_length=XX, circuit_state=CLOSED, error_type=Exception, error=...
```

**Timeout:**
```
TTS generation timeout after 10s - thread_id=X, duration=10000ms, text_length=XX
```

**Circuit Breaker:**
```
TTS circuit breaker open - thread_id=X, duration=XXms, text_length=XX, circuit_state=OPEN, error=...
```
