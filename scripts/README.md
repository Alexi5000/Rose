# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts for development, testing, and maintenance.

## Test Runners

### run_tests.sh (Unix/Linux/Mac)
Comprehensive test runner script for running different test suites.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/run_tests.sh [test_type] [options]
```

**Test Types:**
- `all` - Run all tests
- `core` - Core functionality tests
- `voice` - Voice interaction tests
- `character` - Rose character tests
- `memory` - Memory system tests
- `performance` - Performance tests
- `deployment` - Deployment validation tests
- `coverage` - Run with coverage report

**Examples:**
```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/run_tests.sh all

# Run voice tests with verbose output
./scripts/run_tests.sh voice -v

# Run with coverage report
./scripts/run_tests.sh coverage
```

### run_tests.bat (Windows)
Windows equivalent of the Unix test runner.

**Usage:**
```cmd
scripts\run_tests.bat [test_type] [options]
```

**Examples:**
```cmd
REM Run all tests
scripts\run_tests.bat all

REM Run voice tests
scripts\run_tests.bat voice
```

## Development Scripts

### run_dev_server.py
Starts both the frontend Vite dev server and backend FastAPI server for local development with hot reload.

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/run_dev_server.py
```

**What it does:**
- ðŸ”Œ Starts FastAPI backend on http://localhost:8000 with auto-reload
- ðŸŽ¨ Starts Vite frontend dev server on http://localhost:3000 with hot reload
- ðŸ“š Provides API documentation at http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs
- Handles graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C

**Requirements:**
- Python dependencies installed (`uv sync`)
- Frontend dependencies installed (`cd frontend && npm install`)
- Environment variables configured (`.env` and `frontend/.env`)

### build_and_serve.py
Builds the frontend for production and starts the FastAPI server to serve both static files and API.

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/build_and_serve.py
```

**What it does:**
- ðŸŽ¨ Builds frontend with production optimizations (minification, tree-shaking)
- ðŸ“¦ Outputs to `src/ai_companion/interfaces/web/static/`
- ðŸš€ Starts FastAPI server on http://localhost:8000
- Serves both the compiled frontend and API endpoints

**Use Cases:**
- Testing production build locally before deployment
- Verifying build output and static file serving
- Performance testing with optimized assets

## Utility Scripts

### fix-secret.sh
Git history cleanup script for removing secrets from commit history.

**Note:** This script is for emergency use only. Prefer preventing secrets from being committed in the first place using `.gitignore` and pre-commit hooks.

## Adding New Scripts

When adding new scripts to this directory:

1. **Use descriptive names** - Script purpose should be clear from filename
2. **Add execute permissions** (Unix/Linux/Mac):
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/your-script.sh
   ```
3. **Document in this README** - Add usage instructions
4. **Include help text** - Scripts should support `--help` flag
5. **Handle errors gracefully** - Exit with appropriate error codes

## Best Practices

- Keep scripts focused on a single task
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Provide clear error messages
- Test scripts on all target platforms
- Document dependencies and requirements
