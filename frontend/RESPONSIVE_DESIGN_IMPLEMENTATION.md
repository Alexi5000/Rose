- iOS-specific optimizations:
  - Removed tap highlight color
  - Disabled touch callout
  - Prevented text selection
- Android-specific optimizations:
  - Haptic feedback support
  - Proper touch event handling

**New Utilities Created:**
- `triggerHapticFeedback()` - Vibration feedback
- `preventDefaultTouchBehaviors()` - Prevent unwanted touch behaviors
- `isTouchDevice()` - Detect touch capability
- `isIOS()` / `isAndroid()` - Platform detection
- `getOptimalTouchTargetSize()` - Platform-specific touch target sizes
- `debounceTouchEvent()` / `throttleTouchEvent()` - Performance optimization

**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/utils/touchOptimization.ts`

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/UI/VoiceButton.tsx`

### 16.4 Test and Refine Responsive Layouts ✅

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced HeroTitle with comprehensive responsive text sizing
- Added proper spacing and padding for all screen sizes
- Implemented text shadows for better readability
- Verified UI element positioning across devices

**Responsive Typography:**
- Mobile (sm): 4xl/base with reduced letter spacing
- Tablet (md): 6xl/xl
- Desktop (lg): 7xl/2xl
- Large Desktop (xl): 8xl/3xl
- Proper spacing adjustments per breakpoint

**Layout Optimizations:**
- Top padding: 8 (mobile), 12 (desktop)
- Horizontal padding: 4 (all sizes) to prevent text cutoff
- Letter spacing: 0.25em (mobile), 0.3em (desktop)
- Drop shadows for better contrast

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/UI/HeroTitle.tsx`
