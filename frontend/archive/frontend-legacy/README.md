# Frontend Legacy Archive

This directory retains historical documents and retired code that previously lived at the root of the `frontend` package. Nothing under this folder ships with the production bundle; reference it only when you need past implementation notes or timelines.

## Contents

- `docs/` – former project summaries, verification reports, and implementation notes
- `src/hooks/*.legacy.ts` – superseded recording hooks kept for retrospective analysis

Future cleanups can prune this archive once the information is safely mirrored elsewhere.
