#### Igloo Interior Light
- **Intensity**: Increased from 2.0 to 2.2 for stronger glow
- **Distance**: Increased from 3 to 3.5 for wider glow spread

#### Igloo Entrance Light
- **Intensity**: Increased from 0.5 to 0.6 for better visibility
- **Distance**: Increased from 1.5 to 1.8 for wider coverage

### 4. Refined Gradients

#### Sky Gradient
- Adjusted color stops for smoother transitions:
  - Stop 2: Moved from 0.4 to 0.35 (earlier transition)

- **Luminance Smoothing**: Increased from 0.9 to 0.95 for smoother bloom
- **Radius**: Increased from 0.85 to wider spread

#### Color Grading
- **Brightness**: Increased from 0.05 to 0.08 for better visibility
- **Contrast**: Increased from 1.1 to 1.15 for more punch
- **Saturation**: Increased from 1.2 to 1.25 for richer colors
- **Temperature**: Increased from 0.1 to 0.12 for warmer feel

#### Vignette
- **Offset**: Increased from 0.3 to 0.35 for subtler effect
- **Darkness**: Reduced from 0.5 to 0.45 for less aggressive darkening

### 6. Refined Fog Configuration

- **Color**: Uses warm pink from refined palette
- **Near**: Reduced from 30 to 25 for earlier fog start
- **Far**: Reduced from 100 to 90 for more atmospheric depth

### 7. Aurora Configuration
